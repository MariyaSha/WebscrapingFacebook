<br>
<b>Why?</b>
<br>
Facebook provides an easy tool to save all your information, including
<br>
photos, from your profile - straight to your computer.
<br>
The only issue is - it only saves YOUR photos, but none of the photos you 
<br>
were tagged in, hosted on other peoples' profile.
<br>
My beautiful Facebook scraper will extract both - your personal photos,
<br>
as well as the photos you were tagged in.
<br>
<br>
<b>Just please adjust the URL inside the code to match the URL of your
<br>
own profile/username ("goldie.may.750" will direct you to my empty account)</b>
<br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind - it's not the first time I'm building this scraper,
<br>
and it seems that Facebook is dynamically adjusting its' own code to prevent
<br>
scrapers like this from working properly. My last scraper became obsolete 2 days
<br>
(2 DAYS!!!) after I created it and downloaded 650+ photos from my personal account. 
<br>
In case their code changes again, please keep in mind that you might need to adjust
<br>
one or two lines to accomodate whatever they changed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Good luck!</b>
